# **BikeVault!**

A platform for users to display their favorite bikes they either own or wish they had!

### How the app works:

The user is able to create/add a bike with information like Make, Year, Model, and Description by navigating to the "Add Bike" page and it will show up in a neatly formatted, easy to keep track of card on the "All Bikes" index page!
